# DrumpfTower

Join Donald as he makes his way through Drumpf Tower, collecting fake ballots from the swing states he needs to win the election while avoiding attacks from Hillary and the Democrats. 
What will be inside the sketchy white van in the parking garage - the votes he needs, or Hillary armed with a dart gun loaded with sedatives? 
What will you find in the Drumpf Dungeon, where you will have to search for votes on the floor under Bernie's lipstick-stained suit (and hey, whose lipstick is that?!) 
And what will happen when you respond to the Russian hackers' Caesar cipher-ed email?Will Donald make it to the penthouse with the votes he needs in hand before the final vote count? 
Find out all this and more by playing my game, "Donnie's  Grand Adventure." It's gonna be beautiful!
